Description
For this website when the user navigates to the homepage there is a nav link at the top right to login.  When the user clicks on it they are prompted to either login or create an account.  Once the user creates an account they can then login.  The goal is for the website to be a blog website where the user can post messages on the blog.  Once logged in the user can view their profile and see the messages they have posted with the possiblity of deleting them. 
    I found this assignment really interesting and really deepened my understanding of how we can use routing to pull in information from other files and how they are all interconnected.  For the first few assignments I was a little foggy on how they all interacted with each other- I feel like I understand it now.  I had trouble getting the messaging portion of the website to function. I think there is something wrong with the routing.  I would really like to finish this hw more thoroughly and maybe I will once it is graded just to see where I went wrong.  See below for sources for some of the code.


The main source I used for the file structure and some of the code was the lesson 14 MVC mini project.  I used the file structure and tried to adapt it to a blog-post website.
